        <h2 class="content-subhead">Desired behavior</h2>
        <p>
          The car should find a parallel parking spot, and park without
          hitting other cars.
        </p>

        <h2 class="content-subhead">Available sensors</h2>
        <p>
          For this practice, we have three lasers; one at the front,
          one at the right and one at the back.
        </p>

        <h2 class="content-subhead">Actuators</h2>
        <p>
          We can set  linear velocity and angular velocity of the car.
        </p>

        <h2 class="content-subhead">Approach</h2>
        <p>
          I am going to use a finite state machine architecture, where
          each state is a python class that inherits from an "abstract"
          and general base class. This classes must implement the methods
          defined in the base class, since later another class "FSM" is going
          to take those classes and call the base methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The methods are:
        </p>
        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/state_classes.svg" alt="diagram 1">

        <p>
          This facilitates the execution of the FSM, since then a
          single command has to be executed:
        </p>

        <h2 class="content-subhead">States</h2>

        <h3>SearchSpot</h3>
        <p>
          In this state the car advances while checking with the right
          laser if there is a spot where it can fit. To do that, it checks
          the values of the laser in a certain angle as can be seen in the
          next image. If a value in that range is less than a threshold,
          then there is an obstacle, so it cannot park.
        </p>
        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/diagrama_1.png" alt="diagram 1">
        <p>
          The moment it finds a spot, it transitions to the next state.
        </p>

        <h3>GoForward</h3>
        <p>
          The car advances while checking the distance with the back car
          using the back laser. As long as that distance is below a
          certain threshold, it's still too close, so it keeps advancing.
        </p>

        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/diagrama_2.png" alt="diagram 1">

        <p>
          Once it exceeds the threshold, it transitions to the next state.
        </p>

        <h3>GoBackwards</h3>
        <p>
          The car starts to go backwards with a positive angular velocity
          (turning the wheel to the right in a real car). Once the
          distance with the back car goes below a threshold, it changes
          to a negative angular velocity (wheel to the left).
        </p>

        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/diagrama_3.png" alt="diagram 1">

        <p>
          Now it continues until it reaches another threshold:
        </p>

        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/diagrama_4.png" alt="diagram 1">

        <p>
          When this occurs, it transitions to the next state.
        </p>

        <h3>Reposition</h3>
        <p>
          In this state the car advances while turning to the right 
          (negative angular velocity).
        </p>
        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/diagrama_5.png" alt="diagram 1">
        <p>
          The moment it reaches a threshold, it transitions to the next state.
        </p>

        <h3>LastPart</h3>
        <p>
          Finally, it advances while turning to the left 
          (positive angular velocity).
        </p>
        <img class="pure-img-responsive" src="images/diagrama_6.png" alt="diagram 1">
        <p>
          The moment it reaches a threshold, it transitions to the
          Finished state, which sets the lineal and angular velocity to 0.
        </p>
